The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (i.e. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). Your challenge is to calculate the nth number of the series, where n is zero-indexed (meaning n=0 is the index of the first number in the series).

Example outputs:
```
| n | output |
|---|--------|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 |
```
